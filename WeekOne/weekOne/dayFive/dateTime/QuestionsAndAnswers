1) Which class would you use to store your birthday in years, months, days, seconds, and nanoseconds?
	I would use the LocalDataTime class as it stores all of these values while keeping it in a easily human-readible format
	
2) Given a random date, how would you find the date of the previous Thursday?
	I would use a combination of a for-loop, the .minusDays() method, and the .getDayOfWeek() method
	ex: for(int i = 0; i < 7; i++)
			if(givenDate.minusDays(i).getDayOfWeek() == DayOfWeek.THURSDAY)
				return givenDate.minusDays(i)

3) What is the difference between a ZoneId and a ZoneOffset?
	ZoneId is the super class of ZoneOffset. ZoneOffset is simply the time zone difference of a Time zone from UTC while ZoneId controls
	the logic for converting time zones and information on the zone such as the location/region (like Europe/Paris)
	
4) How would you convert an Instant to a ZonedDateTime? How would you convert a ZonedDateTime to an Instant?
	Java has numerous built in methods to convert from an Instant to a ZonedDateTime such as ofInstance(Instant instant, ZoneId zone)
	ZonedDateTime also inherits the toInstant method to convert itself into an Instant
